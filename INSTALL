=== How to Install

First, group with your highest level Unix guru, and have him or her tank.
Greed is easier to install than other muds, but every site is different.

(1) Get the release greed-1.0-GOLD.tar.gz from one of these fine
    anonymous ftp sites:

	ftp.game.org

    Or the GreedMud homepage at:

	http://mega.ist.utl.pt/~vasc

(2) Unpack the release.

	gzip -d greed-1.0-GOLD.tar.gz | tar xvf -

(3) Go into the 'src' directory.  Type 'make'.

    See 'port.txt' for more information on porting, including the
    Windows 9x/NT platform.

(4) Run 'make' with the following options:

	make -k >&! make.out

    This will take 10 minutes to 60 minutes, depending on the speed of your
    computer.

    If you encounter errors with 'make', send me your 'make.out' file:

	mail -s make.out greedmud@yahoogroups.com < make.out

    Also I'll need to know what kind of hardware, operating system,
    and C compiler you have.

    I will help you get Greed running, but obviously I can't guarantee
    Greed will run on any particular machine.

(5) Start the game:

	startup &
	telnet localhost 5005
	
(6) To make your first immortal character, just start as a mortal
    character, play at least as far as level 2, and then edit the
    player file and change your level.  (After the first immortal,
    you can advance the rest).

(7) If you haven't already done so, read 'license.grd', 'license.doc',
    'license.txt', and 'license.nvy'.  Because Greed is a derivative work
    of Diku Mud, you must register your mud with the original Diku
    implementors.
  
(8) Of course you're going to change the title screen, help files, and so on.
    Don't just globally erase the 'Merc' references, ok?  You wouldn't
    like it if they did that to your work, so don't do it to theirs.
